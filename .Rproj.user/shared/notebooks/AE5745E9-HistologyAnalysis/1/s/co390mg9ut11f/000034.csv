"1","We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and BOBYQA optimizer) to predict perc_cartregen_length with AgeCat and Slide_per (formula:
perc_cartregen_length ~ AgeCat + Slide_per + AgeCat * Slide_per). The model included AnimalID as random effect (formula: ~1 | AnimalID). The model's total
explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.74) and the part related to the fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.62. The model's intercept,
corresponding to AgeCat = Uninjured Tissue and Slide_per = 0, is at 96.15 (95% CI [85.55, 106.75], t(237) = 17.87, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of AgeCat [Injured at 3-4mo] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -34.07, 95% CI [-50.02, -18.12], t(237) = -4.21, p < .001; Std. beta =
-1.40, 95% CI [-1.92, -0.87])
  - The effect of AgeCat [Injured at 4-6mo] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -24.71, 95% CI [-40.74, -8.67], t(237) = -3.04, p = 0.003; Std. beta =
-1.19, 95% CI [-1.72, -0.67])
  - The effect of AgeCat [Injured at 6-9mo] is statistically non-significant and negative (beta = -13.56, 95% CI [-30.91, 3.79], t(237) = -1.54, p = 0.125; Std. beta
= -1.33, 95% CI [-1.86, -0.79])
  - The effect of AgeCat [Injured at ≥ 22mo] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -28.67, 95% CI [-44.44, -12.91], t(237) = -3.58, p < .001; Std. beta =
-2.07, 95% CI [-2.59, -1.55])
  - The effect of Slide per is statistically non-significant and positive (beta = 7.82e-03, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.11], t(237) = 0.15, p = 0.880; Std. beta = 8.99e-03, 95%
CI [-0.11, 0.13])
  - The effect of AgeCat [Injured at 3-4mo] × Slide per is statistically non-significant and negative (beta = -0.02, 95% CI [-0.19, 0.14], t(237) = -0.27, p = 0.786;
Std. beta = -0.03, 95% CI [-0.21, 0.16])
  - The effect of AgeCat [Injured at 4-6mo] × Slide per is statistically non-significant and negative (beta = -0.10, 95% CI [-0.27, 0.07], t(237) = -1.19, p = 0.236;
Std. beta = -0.12, 95% CI [-0.31, 0.08])
  - The effect of AgeCat [Injured at 6-9mo] × Slide per is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.37, 95% CI [-0.57, -0.18], t(237) = -3.78, p < .001;
Std. beta = -0.43, 95% CI [-0.65, -0.20])
  - The effect of AgeCat [Injured at ≥ 22mo] × Slide per is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.44, 95% CI [-0.61, -0.28], t(237) = -5.31, p < .001;
Std. beta = -0.51, 95% CI [-0.70, -0.32])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed
using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
