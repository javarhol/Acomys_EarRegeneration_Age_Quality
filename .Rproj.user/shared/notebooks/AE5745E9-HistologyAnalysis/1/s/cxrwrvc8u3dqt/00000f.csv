"1","We fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using REML and BOBYQA optimizer) to predict perc_cartregen_length with Slide_per and
AgeCat (formula: perc_cartregen_length ~ Slide_per + AgeCat). The model included Slide_per as random effects (formula:
~Slide_per | AnimalID). The model's total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.61) and the part related to the
fixed effects alone (marginal R2) is of 0.33. The model's intercept, corresponding to Slide_per = 0 and AgeCat = Uninj. Tissue,
is at 78.60 (95% CI [64.52, 92.68], t(162) = 11.02, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of Slide per is statistically significant and negative (beta = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.39, -0.11], t(162) = -3.45, p <
.001; Std. beta = -0.35, 95% CI [-0.55, -0.15])
  - The effect of AgeCat [4-6mo] is statistically non-significant and positive (beta = 3.88, 95% CI [-9.47, 17.23], t(162) =
0.57, p = 0.567; Std. beta = 0.18, 95% CI [-0.45, 0.82])
  - The effect of AgeCat [6-9mo] is statistically non-significant and negative (beta = -4.24, 95% CI [-17.90, 9.43], t(162) =
-0.61, p = 0.541; Std. beta = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.85, 0.45])
  - The effect of AgeCat [≥ 22mo] is statistically significant and negative (beta = -24.53, 95% CI [-37.85, -11.21], t(162) =
-3.64, p < .001; Std. beta = -1.17, 95% CI [-1.80, -0.53])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals
(CIs) and p-values were computed using a Wald t-distribution approximation.
"
"0","#the model without the interaction is the best. It indicates that generally, cartilage % is decreasing from proximal to distal, and that ≥ 22mo have less cartilage % than 3-4mo"
"0","#can we redo the analysis to make proximal to distal continuous?"
